# Jewelstore (AR Jewelry E-Commerce Store)
# Problem Statement
['Homemakers in rural India hold over 11% of the actual amount of gold in the world. Consequently, Indian women collectively wear over 21,000 tons of gold on their bodies. To put this figure into perspective, the Indiansâ€™ obsession with gold has pushed them to accumulate more gold than all the reserves of the IMF, USA, Germany, and Switzerland put together.'](https://blog.novemgold.com/interesting-fact-indian-housewives-hold-11-of-the-worlds-gold/) However, almost all of the jewelry shopping is done traditionally. This is a market longing for a disruption. ['Only 7.6% of the global jewelry shopping was done online and India only had an online penetration of 1.2%'](https://retailjewellerindia.com/how-big-is-the-online-jewellery-market-in-india/). What could be the reasons of such low market penetration in online jewellery shopping? 

 - **Trust**
 *The majority of people still don't buy gold or diamonds without visiting a shop. Jewellery is a luxury purchase and is an investment for any Indian household. They don't want to take risks. They want to choose the best design, check on the purity of gold, see its make in reality and then make a decision.*
 - **Can't experience the touch and feel**
 *Not being able to try on rings and other jewelry. Not seeing the actual product to check the quality of the item you want to buy.*
 
 There could be countless other reasons and factors, but we aim at solving these two for our client **Siddhi Jewellers**. They are trusted by their clients, but what if we can elevate the trust using technology. What if we can integrate Augmented Reality with Jewellery Shopping? This idea was the motivator of this project. Combining something as fresh as AR into something as traditional as Jewellery shopping. It is undeniable that humans love hoarding jewellery. Many consider gold and diamond an investment and technology is meant to solve our problems. We aim at solving this problem using technology.
