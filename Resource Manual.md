# Problem Statement
['Homemakers in rural India hold over 11% of the actual amount of gold in the world. Consequently, Indian women collectively wear over 21,000 tons of gold on their bodies. To put this figure into perspective, the Indiansâ€™ obsession with gold has pushed them to accumulate more gold than all the reserves of the IMF, USA, Germany, and Switzerland put together.'](https://blog.novemgold.com/interesting-fact-indian-housewives-hold-11-of-the-worlds-gold/) However, almost all of the jewelry shopping is done traditionally. This is a market longing for a disruption. ['Only 7.6% of the global jewelry shopping was done online and India only had an online penetration of 1.2%'](https://retailjewellerindia.com/how-big-is-the-online-jewellery-market-in-india/). What could be the reasons of such low market penetration in online jewelry shopping? 

 - **Trust**
 *The majority of people still don't buy gold or diamonds without visiting a shop. Jewelry is a luxury purchase and is an investment for any Indian household. They don't want to take risks. They want to choose the best design, check on the purity of gold, see its make in reality and then make a decision.*
 - **Can't experience the touch and feel**
 *Not being able to try on rings and other jewelry. Not seeing the actual product to check the quality of the item you want to buy.*
 
 There could be countless other reasons and factors, but we aim at solving these two for our client **Siddhi Jewellers**. They are trusted by their clients, but what if we can elevate the trust using technology. What if we can integrate Augmented Reality with Jewelry Shopping? This idea was the motivator of this project. Combining something as fresh as AR into something as traditional as Jewelry shopping. It is undeniable that Indians love hoarding jewelry. Many consider gold and diamond an investment and technology is meant to solve our problems. We aim at solving this problem using technology. 

Our objective is to provide an experience to the customers of **Siddhi Jewellers**. Making a seamless and realistic web-based experience to the customers. Making browsing, ordering, trying, and payment - secure, trusted and reliable for both the owner and the customer.
